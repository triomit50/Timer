## Description
This is a simple Timer program, which can accept user-defined hours, minutes and seconds for the countdown, and then, the countdown is started. A small notification alert is played at the end of the timer.

## How to run
The "code.py" file contains the main code content for the timer. The "mainShell.py" file is the main excutable file which contains the shell code (excluding the main timer function code). Both of these files should be saved in the same folder. The "mainShell.py" file can be executed, without any risk of committing any changes in the main function code content.
